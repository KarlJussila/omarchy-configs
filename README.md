# What is this repo for?
This is just my own configs and scripts for my own Omarchy setup at the moment. I'm keeping it on github for bookkeeping a backup purposes, so I can restore my system to a working state if something goes wrong. I aim to implement changes in line with Omarchy's minimal, readable design philosophy, and to that end, I will try to include as few extra package dependencies as possible beyond Omarchy defaults. That said, there are some packages I would like to include in my system and interact with or customize, so there will be a small list of dependencies. That list is provided below.

## Dependencies (just the one for now)
- flatpak
  - Only referenced by flatpak install/remove scripts. Otherwise optional.
